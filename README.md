# 🚗 Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing accident data using **Microsoft Excel** to uncover trends, causes, and patterns that can help improve road safety. The interactive dashboard provides actionable insights into accident hotspots, vehicle involvement, and time-based accident patterns.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Road accidents are a critical issue, leading to loss of lives, injuries, and property damage. Policymakers and traffic authorities often face challenges in:

* Identifying **accident-prone areas**
* Understanding the **causes of accidents**
* Analyzing **time-based patterns** (day, month, season)
* Determining the **impact of vehicle type and road conditions**

Without data-driven insights, it becomes difficult to design effective road safety measures.

## 🛠 Approach to Solve

1. **Data Collection:** Accident dataset prepared and imported into Excel.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Ensured consistency, removed errors, and formatted the dataset for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified accident trends using pivot tables, charts, and Excel functions.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** Designed an **interactive dashboard** using slicers, conditional formatting, and charts for clear visualization.
5. **Insights Generation:** Extracted key findings to support decision-making.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Understanding

The dataset underwent the following steps:

* **Handling Missing Values:** Removed or imputed missing accident details.
* **Standardization:** Unified formats for dates, vehicle types, and locations.
* **Error Checking:** Corrected duplicate entries and inconsistencies in accident categories.
* **Derived Columns:** Created calculated fields (e.g., accident severity category, time-of-day groupings).
* **Exploration:** Checked distributions and frequency of accidents by year, month, and vehicle type.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

* **Accidents by Year & Month** (trend analysis)
* **Accidents by Location** (hotspot detection)
* **Accidents by Vehicle Type** (car, bus, two-wheeler, etc.)
* **Accident Severity** (minor, major, fatal)
* **Interactive Filters:** Users can filter data by year, location, and severity for deeper analysis.

---

## 🔑 Key Insights

* Identified **peak accident times** and months.
* Highlighted **most affected vehicle categories**.
* Found **high-risk accident zones** requiring immediate policy attention.
* Showed **severity patterns** across different conditions.
